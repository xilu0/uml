10 Years of Experience | Seeking: DevOps Engineer | Desired Salary: 30-35K RMB | Desired City: Shenzhen

## Summary

For the past four years, I have been working on Go backend development and CI/CD pipeline development based on Jenkins for two security software projects. The products are deployed on customized Linux, adapted to specialized hardware similar to network devices, and ultimately delivered to customers as integrated software and hardware solutions.

I have accumulated proficiency in Linux systems, a deep understanding of kernel modules, C/C++ compilation and dynamic libraries, networking, file systems, RPM packaging, KVM, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, and RabbitMQ. My primary language is Golang, and I frequently use libraries such as gin and gorm. I can quickly adapt to any unfamiliar library.

I have extensive experience in developing and optimizing CI/CD pipelines.  While I was previously familiar with Python, I can still use it adequately.

I emphasize the use of design patterns in my development work and have deliberately studied them comprehensively.  I follow the 4+1 architectural view model for high-level design and have a thorough understanding of UML, which I utilize in my projects.

I have been following and using GitHub Copilot since its release, and I have also tried MarsCode and the company's self-developed GenCode. I am proficient in using them and have a strong interest in new technologies.

In the earlier six years of my career, my work primarily focused on OpenStack and Kubernetes. I was an early adopter and researcher of these two platform technologies. My first job involved researching and using OpenStack, which was quite challenging.  Ultimately, I became familiar with its architecture and gained extensive deployment and operations experience.  During that time, I also became proficient in Python, Ceph, and KVM, laying a solid foundation for my DevOps skills.

I have worked almost exclusively with Kubernetes for over three years, gaining a broad understanding of the entire ecosystem and accumulating extensive experience. I obtained CKA certification in early 2020. I am familiar with the underlying principles, architecture, common usage, and operator development.

With ten years of accumulated experience, I have a deep understanding of software operations and development, extensive project experience, familiarity with various IT systems, and a comprehensive knowledge and skill set. I have deliberately studied software engineering, software development processes, DevOps, SRE, and other related fields, and have a deep understanding of them.

I possess excellent self-management skills, set goals carefully, plan time efficiently, manage tasks effectively, and maintain a high level of efficiency and quality through continuous learning and optimization.

Whether it's backend development, DevOps, or serving as a technical lead, I am fully committed, proactive in exploring, and utilizing AI technologies.

*   **Clearer Descriptions of Responsibilities:**  I've expanded on some of your responsibilities to provide more context and detail, making it easier for a recruiter to understand your contributions.  I've used strong action verbs (e.g., "developed," "implemented," "managed," "optimized").
*   **Emphasis on Achievements:** I've highlighted your achievements more clearly, using bullet points and quantifiable results where possible (e.g., "generate over 200 million RMB in revenue").
*   **"Content" and "Achievements" Sections:** I've used a consistent format for describing roles, separating "Content" (the overall description of the role or project) from "Achievements" (your specific accomplishments).  This is a common and effective resume structure.
*   **Technology Lists:**  I've made the technology lists more readable and used consistent capitalization.
*   **Consistent Tense:** I've used the past tense consistently for completed work experience and projects.
* **Added key words**: Added several frequently-used key words in the resume to improve the ATS score.
